        <h2>Article 1: Binding Legal Contract</h2>
        <p>This Terms of Service ("Agreement") is a digital legal contract between you and <strong>SR GAMING PRIVATE LIMITED</strong>. By clicking "Login," "Register," or participating in any battle on <strong>srludo.online</strong>, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by every clause herein. If you do not agree, you are legally prohibited from accessing our Firebase-driven ecosystem.</p>
        <p>This Agreement governs your use of the SR Ludo platform, including the dual-wallet system, the match-making interface, and the automated result-settlement engine.</p>

        <div class="restriction-banner">
            STRICT WARNING: USERS UNDER 18 AND RESIDENTS OF ASSAM, ODISHA, NAGALAND, SIKKIM, AP, AND TELANGANA ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING PAID SERVICES.
        </div>

        <h2>Article 2: The "Doctrine of Skill" Jurisprudence</h2>
        <p>SR Ludo is a specialized platform hosting <strong>Games of Skill</strong>. Under the Constitution of India and various landmark precedents (e.g., <i>K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu</i>), games where success depends predominantly on the player's cognitive skills are not gambling.</p>
        <p>Ludo on our platform requires players to utilize superior memory, probability calculation, strategic blocking, and time-management. Therefore, the fee paid to join a battle is a "Participation Fee" for a competitive skill event, not a wager. We explicitly state that this is <strong>NOT a betting or gambling platform</strong>.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 3: Firebase Account & Security Framework</h2>
        <p>To provide enterprise-grade security, SR Ludo utilizes <strong>Firebase Secure Authentication</strong>. 
        <h3>3.1. Account Conversion</h3>
        <p>Each user is assigned a unique hashed ID based on their mobile number, converted into an internal email-format identifier. This ensures that your data remains encrypted within the Google Cloud infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>3.2. Single Account Policy</h3>
        <p>A user is permitted only ONE account per Aadhaar card. Any user found operating "Sybil" or duplicate accounts will have all associated accounts terminated and all funds (Cash and Winning) permanently forfeited.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 4: Aadhaar Identity Verification Protocol (IVP)</h2>
        <p>To ensure 100% legal compliance, <strong>KYC is mandatory</strong>. We collect your Aadhaar Number and Aadhaar Front Photo through the <strong>ImgBB Secure API</strong>.</p>
        <p>This data is processed for three reasons: (1) To verify that you are at least 18 years of age; (2) To ensure you are not from a Restricted State; and (3) To prevent money laundering (AML compliance). Failure to provide authentic documents will result in a withdrawal block.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 5: Financial Wallet Governance</h2>
        <div class="wallet-logic">
            <h3>5.1. Deposit Cash Wallet</h3>
            <p>Funds added to this wallet are classified as non-withdrawable "Play Credits." These are intended solely for participation in skill matches. Under no circumstances can these funds be returned as cash to prevent illegal financial loops.</p>
            <h3>5.2. Winning Wallet</h3>
            <p>Credits won through match victories are transferred to this wallet. These funds are eligible for withdrawal only after the match result is verified via the ImgBB screenshot engine and Admin audit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 6: Battle Protocol & Dispute Settlement</h2>
        <p>Every match is a "Battle." Players must generate/join a room using the <strong>Ludo King</strong> application and share the Room Code on our Firebase Realtime Database interface.</p>
        <h3>6.1. Result Verification</h3>
        <p>The winner must upload a clear, unedited screenshot of the victory screen. Our Admin uses advanced forensic tools to check for edited images. Any user submitting a <strong>Fake Screenshot</strong> will be charged a penalty of ₹50 and faces a permanent ban.</p>
        <h3>6.2. Disputes</h3>
        <p>In case of a disconnect or technical error, the player must provide <strong>Video Evidence</strong> from the start of the game. The final decision rests solely with the SR Ludo Admin Team.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 7: Anti-Fraud & Fair Play Algorithms</h2>
        <p>Our Firebase architecture monitors every interaction. We employ <strong>Heuristic Bot Detection</strong>. If we detect that you are using third-party mods, scripts, or automated tools to play Ludo, your account will be liquidated instantly. We reserve the right to share fraudulent user data with cybercrime authorities in Madhya Pradesh/India.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 8: Intellectual Property & WhatsApp Support</h2>
        <p>The SR Ludo brand, code, and Dual-Wallet logic are the property of <strong>SR GAMING PRIVATE LIMITED</strong>. Official support is provided only via WhatsApp (+91 6261642944). We never ask for your Aadhaar OTP or Account Password.</p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Article 9: Indemnification & Jurisdiction</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify SR Ludo against any losses arising from your breach of these terms. This Agreement is governed by the laws of India. Any legal action shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in <strong>Indore/Jaipur</strong>.</p>
