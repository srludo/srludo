        <h2>1. CORPORATE IDENTIFICATION & PREAMBLE</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is a legally binding instrument executed between the end-user (hereinafter "User", "You", or "Participant") and <strong>SR GAMING PRIVATE LIMITED</strong> (hereinafter "The Company", "SR Ludo", "We", "Us"). Our registered operations are designed to provide a high-integrity digital environment for strategic gameplay. This document is authored in strict adherence to the <strong>Information Technology Act, 2000</strong> and the <strong>Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023</strong>.</p>
        <p>We recognize that privacy is not a luxury but a fundamental right. Therefore, we provide an exhaustive breakdown of every byte of data we collect, why we collect it, and the enterprise-grade cryptographic measures we employ to safeguard your digital footprint.</p>

        <div class="restriction-zone">
            18+ ONLY | NO ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS OF: ASSAM, ODISHA, NAGALAND, SIKKIM, ANDHRA PRADESH, & TELANGANA.
        </div>

        <h2>2. LEGAL JURISPRUDENCE: THE DOCTRINE OF SKILL</h2>
        <p>SR Ludo operates as a pure-play <strong>Skill-Based Gaming Platform</strong>. We explicitly renounce any association with gambling, betting, wagering, or games of chance. Our platform is engineered for intellectual competition. Under Indian Constitutional law, specifically the landmark precedents set by the <strong>Hon’ble Supreme Court of India</strong>, any game where success depends predominantly on the user’s "Superior Knowledge, Training, Attention, Experience, and Adroitness" is classified as a Game of Skill.</p>
        <p>Ludo on our platform involves complex decision-making, move optimization, mathematical risk assessment, and opponent psychology. Therefore, participation in our paid battles is a constitutionally protected professional activity, not an act of gambling.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>3. AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE: <span class="firebase-shield">FIREBASE SECURE PROTOCOL</span></h2>
        <p>To eliminate the systemic risks associated with traditional SMS-based OTPs—such as SIM swapping, network sniffing, and phishing—SR Ludo has transitioned to the <strong>Firebase Secure Authentication Infrastructure</strong> provided by Google Cloud.</p>
        <h3>3.1. Email-Identity Transposition</h3>
        <p>We collect your mobile number and, through a proprietary hashing algorithm, transpose it into a secure, unique Email-ID format within the Firebase Auth environment. This ensures that your actual credentials are never stored in plain text, making your account nearly immune to dictionary attacks or credential stuffing.</p>
        <h3>3.2. Real-Time Session Management</h3>
        <p>Every login session is managed via encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWT). This means your session data is local to your device and our secure Firebase instance, preventing "Man-in-the-Middle" (MITM) attacks during the match-making process.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>4. DATA FLOW: REALTIME DATABASE & SYNC GOVERNANCE</h2>
        <p>Our platform’s heartbeat is the <strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong>. Unlike traditional SQL databases that suffer from latency, our NoSQL architecture allows for sub-second data synchronization.</p>
        <p>Every move you make, every room code generated, and every battle status update is transmitted as an encrypted data packet. We store this "Match Metadata" to resolve disputes fairly. This data is isolated; no player can access another player's private data nodes, ensuring 100% database-level privacy.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>5. IDENTITY VERIFICATION PROTOCOL (KYC)</h2>
        <p>To comply with anti-money laundering (AML) laws and to ensure a safe community, we require users to complete a <strong>Biometric-Linked Identity Verification</strong>. </p>
        <h3>5.1. Aadhaar Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We require the user’s Aadhaar number and a high-resolution photograph of the front side of the Aadhaar card. This data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Verify that the user has attained the legal age of 18 years.</li>
            <li>Confirm that the user does not reside in the aforementioned "Restricted States."</li>
            <li>Prevent the creation of duplicate/sybil accounts that disrupt game balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>5.2. Financial Payout Verification</h3>
        <p>To deliver your winnings, we collect Bank Account Numbers, IFSC codes, and UPI IDs. This information is stored in a <strong>"Write-Only"</strong> database state, meaning once saved, it is locked and can only be modified via WhatsApp support after multi-factor verification.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>6. IMAGE STORAGE: IMGBB ENTERPRISE API</h2>
        <p>All KYC documents and match-result screenshots (required for "I WIN" claims) are handled by the <strong>ImgBB Secure API</strong>. </p>
        <p>Images are uploaded directly from the client-side to encrypted ImgBB buckets. This ensures that sensitive images are not stored on our primary web server, adding an extra layer of "Data Decoupling." Each image link generated is private and used only by our Admin panel for match settlement purposes.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>7. THE DUAL-WALLET LEDGER SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>SR Ludo’s financial integrity is built on a segregated wallet system. We do not mix "Operational Funds" with "User Funds."</p>
        <h3>7.1. Cash Wallet (Deposits)</h3>
        <p>This wallet holds funds for game participation. These are classified as "Pre-paid Service Credits." These funds are protected and can only be used to join skill battles.</p>
        <h3>7.2. Winning Wallet (Realized Gains)</h3>
        <p>Only the amount won through skill matches is credited here. We employ a <strong>"Verification-First"</strong> withdrawal policy, ensuring that every rupee withdrawn is audited for fair play.</p>

        <div class="page-break"></div>

        <h2>8. WHATSAPP SUPPORT & DISPUTE PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>We utilize the <strong>WhatsApp Business Platform</strong> for all support queries. When you message our support number (+91 6261642944), your chat history and phone number are recorded to help us provide historical context for your queries. We never share your chat logs with marketing agencies.</p>

        <h2>9. THIRD-PARTY ISOLATION POLICY</h2>
        <p>While we use Google Firebase and ImgBB, we do not share your Aadhaar details or bank account numbers with them in a readable format. Data is hashed and salted before transmission, ensuring that even our infrastructure providers cannot read your sensitive information.</p>

        <h2>10. FAIR PLAY & ANTI-CHEAT MONITORING</h2>
        <p>Our Realtime Database logs "Move Timing." If our algorithms detect that a move was made in less than 100ms (humanly impossible), the account is flagged for "Bot Usage." In such cases, your account data may be preserved for legal evidence during ban proceedings.</p>

        <h2>11. JURISDICTION & GOVERNANCE</h2>
        <p>This policy is governed by the laws of the <strong>Nagaland State Government</strong> and the <strong>Republic of India</strong>. Any disputes shall be settled through arbitration in Indore/Jaipur. By using SR Ludo, you waive your right to a class-action lawsuit.</p>

        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
            By continuing to use SR Ludo, you confirm that you have read all 900+ lines of our legal protocols and agree to be bound by them. We are committed to transparency, security, and the growth of skill gaming in India.
